# Token-Based Federation

## Abstract

Token-Based Federation (TBF) is an OAuth 2.0 federated authorization framework.
TBF defines interfaces, flows and constructs for coordinating access to heterogeneous OAuth 2.0
resource servers across multiple administrative domains.

## Introduction

To begin with, there are two different definitions for the term federation:

1. Information sharing between heterogeneous networks (telecommunications networks)  
2. Collective authority (federated identity)

The TBF framework refers to No. 1

##Architectural Principle

The TBF mechanism is handled by the cross-domain autonomic control loop through two authorization servers each in their own administrative domain. It means that the main loop is cross-domain, and the control is autonomic.
